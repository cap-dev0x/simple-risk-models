# Simple Risk Models
Very simple risk investment analysis mini-models. This repo is just a way 
to save them and is not professional code.

## Model 1 

### Model 1 Overview

The first model is meant to show the impact of an investment on the average
fix time of vulnerabilities found in a given system.


### Notes on Model 1
**Time** - Time is not currently standardized, meant to be fluid for user. 
At this point in time the user is responsible for ensuring that all units 
of time are in their correct formats. 

**Investment Score** - In Model 1, the higher the value is of the investment
score, the greater the impact that investment is perceived to have.
